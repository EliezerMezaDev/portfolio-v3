- **Key technologies:** The application is built with **React** for the interface logic and consumes real-time data from the public `TheCocktailDB.com` API.
- **Focus on animation:** The entire design system and visual effects, such as card transitions and text reveals, were implemented with **SCSS** to explore the power of native CSS animations.
