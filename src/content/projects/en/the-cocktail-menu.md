## About the Project

"The Cocktail Menu" is a personal project developed to practice and experiment with UI animations and transitions. The goal was to create a dynamic and engaging interface using only React and SCSS, without relying on external animation libraries.

- **Key Technologies:** The application is built with **React** for the interface logic and consumes real-time data from the public `TheCocktailDB.com` API.
- **Focus on Animation:** The entire design system and visual effects, such as card transitions and text reveals, were implemented with **SCSS** to explore the power of native CSS animations.
